The most popular legend of Kedarnath takes us to the time of Pandavas who after killing their half-brothers, Kauravas in the infamous war were seeking forgiveness from Lord Shiva on the advice of Lord Krishna. It was in Guptkashi that they could spot Lord Shiva who was hiding from them disguised in the form of Nandi, the bull. But one of the Pandavas, Bheema could identify Lord Shiva and chased to only catch him through his tail, while the rest of the body vanished, through a secret cave underneath the ground.",

        history:"According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva,[34] one of three principal deities along with Brahma and Vishnu. During a conflict between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonoured Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.",
